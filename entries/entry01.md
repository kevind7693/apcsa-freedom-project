As of the time this blog entry is being written, we are on the the blog setup and deciding/tinkering with our tools part of the engineering design process. So far my decided tool for this project is Firebase. My reason for choosing this tool is because I want to make an app that can record what I do on during my daily routine. I still haven't decdied what I wanted to record yet but I know its most likely going to be a quantitative data sort. Firebase stores data from the user which the user can look at to get a sense of what they are doing on a day to day basis. The skills that I am currently is how to google and how to learn. Being able to google properly allows me to get only the correct data while learning how to learn allows me to look at my tool objectively. Seeing the benefits and drawbacks of my tool and deciding whether or not to keep this tool or change to another tool. 

For the next few weeks, I am going to do more research on my tool and see if it will help me create what I envisioned in my head. If it does, I will begin to start learning it after the 2 weeks. If not I would change my tool to another tool more suited to my project.
