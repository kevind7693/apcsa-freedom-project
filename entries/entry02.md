# Entry 2

As of today when I am writing this blog entry, I am currently on the learning your tools part of the engineering design process. So after today my tool is set in stone but I decided to stick with my first tool being Firebase. Firebase which allows my app to have real-time data and focuses more for on the user interface side of things instead of code and the hardware. While looking on the firebase site, I realized that trying to create an app using ios is much more of a pain when compared to android. Thinking back though, I have seem people complaining that apple phones are too restricted compared to that of android phones, maybe this is a similar case as well.  
  
Using this [page](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?authuser=0) to help you get started on my android app, I first needed to install Android Studio which is a google development program used for Android operating systems. Setting help the whole Android Studio would have been a pain if not for this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fis26HvvDII). After following the video's guide on how to set up Android Studio and creating an app with it, I started to create a project in the firebase site. We can view projects as the database for the app we are creating, its pretty similar to git and github with the app in the studio being local while the project is the cloud on the firebase site. But in order for this to work, we need the project ID to link the project with the app. Lucky the project id can be found in the build.gardle file in the app folder in the studio.  
  
So during most of my time, I have used for researching more about my tool and setting up teh foundations for it as well. The skills that I had put to use the most this time was without a doubt learning how to google. Its that since this is completely new territory so having the skill to be able to gather reliable information is definitely the most useful skill in this case.
