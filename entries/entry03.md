During the time of this blog being written, we are currently on the learning our tools part of the engineering design process. My tool being Firebase which is a platform that is used to help us develop web applications and apps. Most of the steps to help me create my first project on Firebase can be found [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/), but since I am working on a web application this [page](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0) proved more useful to me.

During this week, I worked on how to connect my web application to my Firebase project. The steps were simple just copy the code they provide to you on the site right into your index.html file before the ```</body>``` code. After pasting that code in, my web application is sucessfully linked with my firebase project. This site that I created this week was just a test site to see if everything would function as it intended.

In addition to learning Firebase, I also had to learn a bit of Javascript since JS is an essential part of web applications. Learning JS wouldn't be that diffcult since there are many videos and gudies online for me to choose from. Like this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NPcZSrcA5o&t=532s) or going on this [site](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) for some real practice. JS basically allows me to create a more interactive web page since html and css just helps with what the website would look like not how it will work.

Lastly, during this break I used a lot of different skills in order to help me achieve where I am now as I am writing this blog. But the 2 most important skill I believe is time management and knwoing how to google the correct sources. Time management is important since during this week, there is no school so being able to set some time for some coding and tinkering with firebase and JS allows me to keep on top of my projects, so I don't end up procastinating. Being able to google right sources because I don't want to learn from sources that are unreliable.
