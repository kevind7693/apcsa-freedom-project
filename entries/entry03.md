During the time of this blog being written, we are currently on the learning our tools part of the engineering design process. My tool being Firebase which is a platform that is used to help us develop web applications and apps. Most of the steps to help me create my first project on Firebase can be found [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/), but since I am working on a web application this [page](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0) proved more useful to me.

During this week, I worked on how to connect my web application to my Firebase project. The steps were simple just copy the code they provide to you on the site right into your index.html file before the ```</body>``` code.
